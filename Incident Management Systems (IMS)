# Incident Management Systems (IMS)

Incident Management Systems serve as the interface where SOC teams conduct the investigation process and document actions taken during incidents. SOC analysts spend a significant portion of their time working within these systems.

An example of an IMS is the open-source project, [TheHive](https://thehive-project.org/).

Similarly, "Case Management" on LetsDefend can be considered an example of Incident Management Systems.

## How Incident Management Systems (IMS) Works?

To initiate a record on the Incident Management platform, data entry must first be provided. This data can come directly from the SIEM or other security products. Once the data flow is established, a ticket/case is created on the Incident Management System.

If integrations with "Threat Intelligence," "SOAR," and similar platforms are in place, data within the case is enriched, facilitating quick responses. For example, if there is a suspicious domain like "letsdefend.io," integration with a threat intelligence platform allows the automatic querying of the domain's reputation for the SOC analyst. In cases without threat intelligence platform integration, a manual query from open-source platforms like Virustotal is required.

Moreover, SOAR products offer integration with various security products such as Firewall, IPS, WAF, Proxy, Email Gateway, and Email Security products. If a harmful domain like "letsdefend.io" is identified, the SOC can swiftly block access to this address within the organization using SOAR.

Consider the "Investigation Channel" on the LetsDefend Monitoring page. Clicking the "Create Case" button here generates a new "Case" in the "Case Management," essentially creating a new record on the IMS.

Lastly, alert details from SIEM are transmitted to the Incident Management System, which works in coordination with Threat Intelligence and SOAR platforms to process all data, resulting in the creation of a new case/ticket. Threat Intelligence and SOAR integrations on IMS facilitate data enrichment and various actions, and the alert is closed upon completion of operations.

*P.S.: As mentioned earlier, the Incident Management System (IMS) is a platform where SOC analysts spend a significant amount of time. Effectively utilizing IMS platforms can significantly reduce investigation time and eliminate repetitive tasks. Therefore, continuously enhancing your knowledge and skills on IMS platforms is crucial.*
